# Editing the programme

1. When you've selected the sessions, on the [proposals page](https://spaconference.org/scripts/proposals.php), set the status of each proposal. (Open/Accepted/Rejected/Reserve/Pending). The only ones you *need* to set are those which are accepted.
1. From `My SPA` page, follow the link "Edit the published programme". All the sessions that have been marked as "Accepted" in are available to add via drop-downs.
1. Keynote details need to be added manually.
1. The structure of the programme is currently set. If you want to make changes (e.g. finishing earlier or later, moving time/length of keynotes) please contact the website administrator.
1. If you'd like to create four tracks, just schedule sesssions into Wilkes 4 and this will be done automatically.
1. You can preview the programme as much as you like.
1. When you publish, all session pages (e.g. https://spaconference.org/spa2017/sessions/session715.html) and session leader pages (e.g. https://spaconference.org/spa2017/people/eoinwoods.html) are published. It's worth checking through the user pages at this point as some submitters will have entered no details.
3. To add the programme to the site menu, uncomment out the relevant lines in the [`_config.yml` in spa-website](https://github.com/spaconference/spa-website/blob/master/_config.yml).
