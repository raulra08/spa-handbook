# SPA Software in Practice Handbook

This is the handbook for chairs of the [SPA Software in Practice](https://spaconference.org) conference.

This is a blog post Anna wrote a few years ago when we were looking for new conference chairs, it has some general info about being on the committee: [Join the SPA organising committee](https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/join-spa-committee.html)

We have an anonymous review process, you can read more about that here: [How Anonymous Submissions Affected Gender Balance at our Conference](https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/how-anonymity-affected-gender-balance.html).

There is a rough guide of what the chairs do [month-by month](./month-by-month.md). As part of the wider team, we really appreciate as much or as little as you can help with those things throughout the year.

Please browse to see the other info in the handbook.
