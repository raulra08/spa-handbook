# Update and activate the CFP on the website

The CFP is in the spa-website project, in the file [lead-a-session.md](/spaconference/spa-website/blob/master/lead-a-session.md).

Unexclude the CFP files in the _config.yml file to make the CFP visible on the site.

# Publicise the CFP

## SPA attendees mailing list

As conference organiser, you have administrator privileges on the [SPA website](https://spaconference.org). On [your MySpa page](https://spaconference.org/scripts/myprofile.php), you can download a [list of everyone who has consented to be emailed](https://spaconference.org/scripts/org/users-csv.php).

Download that list and replace the list in mailchimp with it.  Then send the CFP to the list.
