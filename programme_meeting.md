# Running the programme meeting

In your MySPA page, if you are an admin, there is a section called "Programme Creation".
1. To get all reviews for the selection process, print out the PDF of all reviews. This includes a summary of all reviews and session details (not including presenters' names).
1. Once you've done a first pass of selecting what sessions are in or out, check the names of the presenters to make sure that no presenter has too many sessions and it's not unbalanced in any other way: View presenters' names in PDF format.
1. For scheduling purposes it's worth knowing that Wilkes 1, 2 and 3 each have a capacity of about 45. If you want to create a fourth track, you can split Wilkes 3 into two, but bear in mind that when Wilkes 3 and Wilkes 4 are both in operation they will each have a capacity of about 25.
1. Put together a reserve list of the top sessions that didn't quite make it (~10 maybe), as some of the accepted speakers will no longer be able to give their sessions; especially if they have multiple sessions accepted.
1. As soon as the programme meeting is finished, email all the accepted speakers and give them a deadline to confirm attendance. We can't publish the programme until the speakers have accepted. You should ask them to update their sessions and user pages at this point, as what they've entered will be published.
1. You should also email the rejected presenters.
1. It is also worth emailing the reserve list to let them know they are in reserve and to give them a date by which we will let them know if they are in or out.
